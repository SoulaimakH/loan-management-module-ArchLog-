# Loan Management Module

We are  asked in lab for a Software architecture course at INSAT to build a loan management module of an existing banking application in order to automate a loan process steps

we've adopted a microservices architecture to enhance development efficiency, scalability, and ease of maintenance. 
Each microservice has a specific business capability, enabling a more focused and modular development approach.

## Tech used
  - Redis
  - NestJS 
  - Angular

## Architecture
A load manager has been implemented to manage and route traffic between the services.
